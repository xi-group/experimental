# Terraform loads variables in the following order, with later sources taking precedence over earlier ones:
# Environment variables
# The terraform.tfvars file, if present.
# The terraform.tfvars.json file, if present.
# Any *.auto.tfvars or *.auto.tfvars.json files, processed in lexical order of their filenames.
# Any -var and -var-file options on the command line, in the order they are provided. (This includes variables set by a Terraform Cloud workspace.)
